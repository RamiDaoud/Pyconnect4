# Pyconnect4 

Pycoonect4 is a connect four game written in Python.

## Dependencies

```bash
python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user
pip install tkinter
```

## Usage

```bash
python3 Play.py
```

## Roadmap

This project implements a connect four game, with the option to play against an AI player with set levels of difficulty. The code is a revised and recycled version of a program I wrote in my early years of programming. Eventually, a GUI will be implemented to visualize the game as well as an option to play against remote players.
